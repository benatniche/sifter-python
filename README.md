# About
sifter-python is a simple wrapper for the Sifter API.  It is written in python and is modeled around the work Garrett Dimon and Adam Keys did with their ruby gem.

This is a work in progress (like my C-Sharp wrapper) and will slowly include milestones, issues, and other resources.

# Getting a page of your issues
- Open print_my_issues.py
- Change the variables to reflect your needs
- Run the file - it will create a page called my_issues.html

# Getting the projects and issues
	import account
	
    a = account.Account(host,token)
    a.projects() # Returns a list of projects
	
	# Get the issues for a project (in this case the first project)
	a.projects()[0].issues()

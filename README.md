# About
sifter-python is a simple wrapper for the Sifter API.  It is written in python and is modeled around the work Garrett Dimon and Adam Keys did with their ruby gem.

This is a work in progress (like my C-Sharp wrapper) and will slowly include milestones, issues, and other resources.

# Getting the projects
	import account
	
    a = account.Account(host,token)
    a.projects() # Returns a list of projects
